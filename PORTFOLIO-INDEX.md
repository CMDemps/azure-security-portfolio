# 📘 Azure Security Portfolio — Project Index

*DevSecOps • Cloud Security Engineering • Threat Detection*

This page serves as a central index for all major projects within my **Azure Cloud Security Portfolio**.  
Each project demonstrates hands-on skills aligned with **Azure Security Engineer (AZ-500)**, **Cybersecurity Architect (SC-100)**, and **real cloud detection engineering** practices.
